I am a former owner of a business that hosted in-person Murder Mystery Games, an animator who worked on the game Yolked at Hard Boiled Studio, and a current MS student in Global Marketing Management at Boston University. 

I have a BS degree in Animation from Drexel University, and I have a passion for creating engaging and immersive experiences for different audiences, using a variety of skills and tools, such as Marketing Technology, 3D creation tools, and post-processing.
